# Website_Power_within_disability

I build this website when I participated in <b>Smart India Hackathon</b> where our task was to create an online employement platform to fulfill the purpose of teaching skills to disable people. Various kinds of skill enhancement courses are provided in this website which disable people can watch and create an employement opportunity for themselves. 

This is main interface of the website
